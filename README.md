# Welcome to AIAI Caramba 🌶️

Hello there! If you're reading this, you're probably as passionate about the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and societal impact as we are. Welcome to **AI for Society**, a collaborative space where students, educators, and researchers at Fontys University of Applied Sciences (FICT) come together to explore the transformative power of AI in shaping a better future for all.

## What's Inside? 📚

Here, you'll find a curated collection of Jupyter notebooks that serve as the digital footprints of our workshops, discussions, and hands-on projects. Whether you're interested in generative AI in the social domain, looking into topics like attachment, influence, or even the philosophy of machine love, this is your playground. 

## Why AI for Society? 🤔

We believe AI is not just about coding and algorithms; it's also about understanding its ethical implications, societal influence, and the potential for transformative change. These notebooks capture the essence of our minor program, AI for Society, which aims to guide students in tackling real-world problems through the lens of AI. 

## Get Involved! 👋

Feel free to clone the repository, dive into the notebooks, and contribute your thoughts and code. Don't be a stranger—pull requests are more than welcome!
